# 🩺 AI-Powered Healthcare Document QA Agent

An intelligent web application that enables users to upload healthcare-related PDF documents (e.g., insurance forms, policies, claims), ask natural language questions, and receive accurate, real-time answers using AI. Built with cutting-edge frontend and backend technologies and deployed seamlessly on Vercel.


## 📌 Agenda

To reduce complexity and confusion in understanding healthcare documents by allowing users to interactively query forms and get clear, natural language explanations powered by LLMs.


## ❓ Problem Statement

Healthcare documents are notoriously difficult to interpret due to legal and technical jargon. Patients and non-experts often find it overwhelming to understand terms like **deductibles**, **co-payments**, or **eligibility clauses**.

> **Goal:** Build a tool where a user can upload a healthcare PDF form and ask questions like:
> - “What is the deductible amount?”
> - “Does this plan cover maternity?”
> - “What are the pre-existing conditions?”


## ✅ Solution

A full-stack application that:
- Accepts PDF documents from users
- Extracts text using `pdf-parse`
- Accepts voice/text input from users
- Streams AI-generated answers using **OpenRouter** and **Mistral-7B Instruct**
- Displays results in real-time with history tracking
- Allows exporting chat history as a PDF
